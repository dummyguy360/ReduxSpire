# ReduxSpire
A Decompilation of Sugary Spire's "P Rank" v1.01 build

## About
This decompilation aims to be somewhat of a moddable recreation of the source code, although tweaked to be cleaner in formatting and indentations
<br>
This decomp DOES use the leaked March Source Code as a reference for things like enums and organization in order to achieve this
<br><br>
More about the project and its configuration can be found in the project's README note

## Dependencies
- GameMaker v2023.2.0.71
