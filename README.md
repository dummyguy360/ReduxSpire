# OpenSpire-Remake
A Decompilation of Sugary Spire's "P Rank" v1.01 build

## About
This DOES NOT use Lila's OpenSpire Decompilation in any way other than in name
<br><br>
This is a completely seperate decompilation attempt, which aims to be moddable and a close recreation of the source code
<br>
This decomp does use the leaked March Source Code as a reference for things like enums and organization in order to achieve this

## Dependencies
- GameMaker v2023.6.0.92
- That's it lmao
