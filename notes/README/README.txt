ReduxSpire
	A Decompilation of the Sugary Spire "P Rank" v1.01 build
		by burnedpopcorn180

GameMaker Version Used: 2023.2.0.71

You can change the Config to change how the game starts up (present in the leaked March Source)
	"Default" will bring you to a Disclaimer Screen, and then to the Main Menu
		(Use this for public builds)
	"Dev" will bring you straight to the dev room
	"Playtester" will send you to a Playtester Disclaimer Screen, which then sends you to the dev room
		(The Playtester Config was the one orginally used when the P rank build was first compiled)
	
"Dev" and "Playtester" Configs also enable some Debug features, such as the ability to screenshot while pausing

To change Configs, press the target button on the top right of the gamemaker window
(same button where you change what platform you want to compile for)
then under the "Config" section, select the config you want

NOTE THAT THE ORIGINAL OPENSPIRE WAS NOT USED
DURING THE MAKING OF THIS DECOMPILATION
